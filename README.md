# Stone-Paper-Scissors-Game :) 

Stone, paper, scissors is a game where two players simultaneously show one of three hand signals to determine a winner:
Stone: A closed fist
Paper: A flat hand with fingers and thumb extended and the palm facing downward
Scissors: A fist with the index and middle fingers fully extended toward the opposing player 
 
The rules of the game are: Stone beats scissors, Scissors beat paper, and Paper beats rock. 
 
Stone, paper, scissors can be a fun and easy game that can help improve critical thinking and communication skills. It's usually played with two players, but you can play with up to three people.

And, In this game i just developed this project for the two persons only in which the first person would be the online player and the second one would be the Computer.
